    <h1>Cool Animals</h1>
    <p>Here's my list of cool animals that you will probably never see.  They are mostly water type animals because those are the coolest.</p>

      <li>
        <h3>Baiji</h3>
        <p>The baiji is a type of dolphin that lives in a river in China.  Maybe it's extinct, maybe not, but right now scientists can't find any.</p>

        <h3>Steller's Sea Cow</h3>
        <p>Its skin is an inch thick, and instead of teeth, it has white bristles.  Imagine eating with your mustache.</p>
